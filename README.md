# Fraud Risk Modeling & Customer Segmentation

This project addresses two key financial challenges: identifying fraudulent credit card transactions and segmenting customers based on behavioral and demographic data. Using machine learning and clustering techniques, the project uncovers actionable insights for fraud prevention and targeted marketing.

## 📌 Objectives
- Detect rare fraud cases in an imbalanced dataset using classification models
- Segment customers based on spending behavior and fraud risk

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, K-Means, StandardScaler

## 📁 Dataset
Credit Card Transactions Dataset from Kaggle

## 📈 Methods Used
- Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Clustering: K-Means with Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Feature Engineering: Aggregates, Ratios, Demographics
- Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, Confusion Matrix

## 🔍 Key Findings
- XGBoost achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.9971 for fraud detection
- Customer segments identified include high-value, low-risk and high-risk profiles
- Recommendations include loyalty programs for low-risk customers and targeted fraud monitoring for risky profiles

## 📊 Visuals
- Feature importance plots
- ROC-AUC curve
- Cluster scatter plots and heatmaps
